# Overview
Stick Hero is a fun and challenging Java game where you help a character cross between buildings by extending a stick with a mouse click. If the stick is too short or too long, the character falls. Along the way, you can collect cherries, track your score, and enjoy bonus features like revives and precision rewards. With smooth animations, sound effects, and intuitive controls, the game offers an engaging experience for players of all levels.

# Key Features
## Stick Extension Mechanism
The core mechanic of the game allows the player to click the left mouse button to grow a stick that helps the character cross to the next building. If the stick fails to reach the building accurately, the character falls, and the game ends.
## Cherry Collection
While crossing between buildings, the character can collect cherries placed along the path. The number of cherries collected is displayed during gameplay, along with the current score and the highest score ever achieved.
## Game Controls
The game includes a save feature that allows players to save their progress and return later. A pause option lets players take breaks during gameplay, and a new game button is available anytime for starting fresh.
## Sounds & Animations
Stick Hero features lively sound effects and smooth animations that respond to player actions. Whether you succeed or fail, the audio-visual feedback makes the experience more engaging and rewarding.
## Bonus Features
Players can flip the character to collect cherries on the other side of the building. If the character falls, three cherries can be used to revive and continue playing. A message is displayed if there aren't enough cherries for revival. Additionally, if the stick lands precisely in the middle of a building, the player earns a two-point bonus, encouraging precision and skillful timing.

# How to Play
- Click the left mouse button to extend the stick and help the character cross to the next building.
- Collect cherries positioned between buildings during gameplay.
- Use the Pause, Save, and New Game buttons to manage your session as needed.
- Flip the character to collect cherries located on the opposite side of the platform.
- Spend 3 cherries to revive the character if they fall. A message will notify you if you donâ€™t have enough.
- Aim to land the stick precisely in the center of the next building to earn a 2-point precision bonus.
